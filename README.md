An ORL dataset contain 400 images of 40 subjects. Each image is converted into a vector and stacked to form a data matrix. The dataset is split into training and test sets, and classification is performed using PCA and LDA with a nearest neighbor classifier. Accuracy is reported for different values of alpha in PCA and compared with LDA results. Classifier tuning is explored using various K values in K-NN . Also analysis includes handling non-face images and different training-test splits.
